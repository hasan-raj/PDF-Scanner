Made a PDF Scanner Using Python, IP-Cam APP in mobile phone and connecting phone and laptop in a common wifi network .

Some of its features are :-

2. You can also see a preview of the pictures that you clicked ,after applying adaptive adaptive thresholding or B&W.
3. And also the pictures that you clicked or to be more precise the pictures that you scanned gets saved in a folder named pdf ,so you also need to create a folder named pdf in the location where your python is saved.
4. Another feature is that you can also add a name to the file , the name with which you want to save the pdf.
5. And also you don't need to worry about the previously saved pictures in the folder named pdf , the latest pdf that you created will only have the pictures that you clicked for that file
